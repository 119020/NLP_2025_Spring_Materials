        "**7. Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART)** Combining CoT prompting and tools in an interleaved manner has shown to be a strong and robust approach to address many tasks with LLMs. These approaches typically require hand-crafting task-specific demonstrations and carefully scripted interleaving of model generations with tool use. Paranjape et al., (2023) propose a new framework that uses a frozen LLM to automatically generate intermediate reasoning steps as a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "ART works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- given a new task, it select demonstrations of multi-step reasoning and tool use from a task library\n",
        "- at test time, it pauses generation whenever external tools are called, and integrate their output before resuming generation\n",
        "\n",
        "ART encourages the model to generalize from demonstrations to decompose a new task and use tools in appropriate places, in a zero-shot fashion. In addition, ART is extensible as it also enables humans to fix mistakes in the reasoning steps or add new tools by simply updating the task and tool libraries. The process is demonstrated below:\n",

            "Human: I know that for employment, many  companies want a potential employee to take a drug test. With THC in particular, how sensitive or specific can that type of drug test be? I know that with other drugs like alcohol and cocaine, they can pinpoint use within one to two days. Is there a way to test specifically for when someone last used marijuana?\n",
            "Assistant: You're right, lots of employers test prospective employees for drugs. While there are some specific things an employer can test for, like cocaine, heroin, meth, and sometimes alcohol, they also look for telltale signs of drug use in general, like unusual personality changes, trouble with motivation, and often can detect someone who is using drugs.  If someone takes a drug test and passes, that means the level of drugs in their system doesn't meet the cutoff limit of a specific drug test.  \n",
            "As for when someone last used marijuana, that is not something a drug test can detect.  It can detect any recent use of marijuana, like within the last few hours, but it cannot pinpoint whether that use was within the past week or so, or several weeks ago.  I'm also not sure if there are any ways for the marijuana user to chemically remove traces of the drug, or if someone could drink the equivalent of a gallon of milk in an hour to wash their system, as was done in Breaking Bad, to remove evidence of recent marijuana use.\n",
            "Assistant: Hm, I'm not a medical expert, but there are a lot of resources online about how urine drug tests work. For example, here is an article from the Washington Post. From what I gather, there's a certain detection window, because different metabolites of THC linger in urine, and that detection window is about three days, for a single use. But it can be even longer than that, because it can also come from your diet or the environment, if someone is a regular user.\n",
